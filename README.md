	All organizations needs a government system. Government distributes the tasks for members of organization. By this way, task is easily handled. Distribution of task has some standards. Also, members handle the tasks by standards. This is what we call laws and rules. Although we have perfect laws and rules, all members may not obey them. Therefore we need punishment. From Sumerians, Babylons, Ionians to nowadays governments used same method for maintain order. They used courts, prisons, mines etc… But all of these are based on center. They didn’t distributed them. But centralism is vulnerable. If center is degenerated or destroyed, order will no longer maintained. But why centralism applied for thousands years? It lies on the fact that larger distance comes with less effect. This is true until a few decades ago. But world is changing rapidly and now we can easily affect no matter how far the distance. Therefore we can abandon centralism and apply distributed government services. High technology can easily handle non-centralized government services. By using blockchain we can build extremely large organizations. Let’s take a look into Bitcoin. Bitcoin is used all over the world. But no one belongs management of it. An order established and the order maintained for two decades without any center. As we attempt to apply the same concept into entire government, we cannot accomplish that. Bitcoin is a non-centralist banking system. But government is more complex than a bank. Unlike a bank, it needs to change laws and rules. There is no known technology in order to make laws. We still need a parliament or a king for legislation. This makes center-free state impossible. We need center based services until a new technology. But government services except a few of them can be used with blockchain and blockchain makes them better. Consider the any of service. If services are private, and data only stored in one place this brings some problems.(i. e. bribe, corruption, degeneration).  Blockchain spreads the all data all over the organization. So, all transactions can be read by everyone and stored more reliable. Transparency can easily prevent corruption. Suppose someone corrupted. All organization can see that and reputation of her/him will be decreased. Therefore he/she will no longer attempt to do it. Another scenario is a potential data loss in center. If the organization uses blockchain, the data spread everywhere and they can easily recover it. The same concept can easily applied all institutions and organizations. Thereby we can obtain more qualified services.
